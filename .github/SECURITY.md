# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

- Use GitHub Security Advisories to privately report a vulnerability to maintainers.
- If Security Advisories are unavailable, open a GitHub issue with the `security` label and limited detail; a maintainer will follow up privately.

## Supported Versions

This project is under active development. We aim to patch the latest release and `main` branch.

## Best Practices

- Do not include secrets in code or logs.
- Prefer environment variables and secret stores.
- Follow least-privilege principles for any infrastructure.
